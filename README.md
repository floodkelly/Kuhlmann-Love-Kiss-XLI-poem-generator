# Kuhlmann-Love-Kiss-XLI-poem-generator

Quirinus Kuhlmann’s “Love-Kiss XLI,” and the combinatorial method behind it, are representative of the historical trend of combinatorial art and combination in poetry, \
evolving from previous forms of permutation and combination such as Ramón Llull’s Ars Brevis (1308) and Gottfried Leibniz’s “On the Universal Characteristic” (1679). This \
project is a code which adapts a rudimentary form of Kuhlmann’s sonnets, employing combination and random choice to write poems in the format of “Love-Kiss XLI.” Kuhlmann \
sonnets are based on his belief that poetry and numbers are a way to unlock wisdom and discover meaning in the universe, and they employ word-combinations and permutations. \
The prototype code creates poems by randomly choosing words to form word-combinations and fitting them into a format of proteus verse, as in “Love-Kiss XLI,” which is \
defined by Leibniz as “a couplet or a longer poem which is constructed in such a way that the order of words can be changed without destroying its meter or rhyme.”
